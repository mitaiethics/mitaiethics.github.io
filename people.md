<a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/lgilpin/">Leilani H. Gilpin</a> is a PhD student in Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science at MIT.  Her area of focus is explanatory artificial
intelligence, which enables autonomous vehicles, and other autonomous
machines to explain themselves. She is currently working on a Toyota
Research Initiative Project, “The Car Can Explain!” in the Computer
Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab under the supervision of
Professor Gerald Jay Sussman.  Before returning to academia, Leilani
worked at Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) and earned a M.S. from Stanford University and a  B.S. in Mathematics (with honors),
B.S. in Computer Science (with highest honors), and a music minor from
UC San Diego in 2011.

<a href="http://harinisuresh.com/">Harini Suresh</a> graduated from MIT with Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science, and she's sticking around for her PhD. She's particularly interested in alogrithmic fairness -- how to make machine learning algorithms more understandable and easier to use responsibly. Her past research focused on predicting intervention onset and weaning with ICU timeseries data. She's spent a couple summers enjoying the West Coast as a data science intern at Jawbone and Zephyr Health. She also love traveling, hiking, farmer's markets, cooking, taking photographs, and reading.
