We welcome and encourage all members of the MIT community. Questions of AI ethics span engineering, humanities, business, and the sciences, so the more perspectives and thoughtful participants, the better! We expect all reading group members to conduct themselves in a respectful, inclusive, and considerate manner.

<a href="http://harinisuresh.com/">Harini Suresh</a> is PhD student in computer science at MIT. She is particularly interested in studying how complications arise when machine learning is used with imperfect real-world data, and building tools that surface possible concerns to end users. She did her undergrad and M.Eng. at MIT as well, and worked on developing interpretable methods for predicting onset and weaning of invasive interventions for patients in Intensive Care Units. She has spent summers working at Google Brain, Jawbone, and Zephyr Health. Outside of research, she loves doing aerial arts, baking all kinds of things, and reading.

<a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/lgilpin/">Leilani H. Gilpin</a> is a PhD student in Electrical Engineering and
Computer Science at MIT.  Her area of focus is explanatory artificial
intelligence, which enables autonomous vehicles, and other autonomous
machines to explain themselves. She is currently working on a Toyota
Research Initiative Project, “The Car Can Explain!” in the Computer
Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab under the supervision of
Professor Gerald Jay Sussman.  Before returning to academia, Leilani
worked at Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) and earned a M.S. from Stanford University and a  B.S. in Mathematics (with honors), B.S. in Computer Science (with highest honors), and a music minor from
UC San Diego in 2011.
